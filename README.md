# timeline.wang

Timeline.wang is an interactive timeline designed by Ainsley Rutterford and James O'Reilly as part of the third year Web Technologies unit at the University of Bristol. The motivation for this website is included in the "about" page on the website, as well as a description of the mathematics used for the animations.
