        Timeline.wang is an interactive timeline created by Ainsley
        Rutterford and James O'Reilly as part of the third year
        computer science unit "Web Technologies" at the University of Bristol.
        The name for the website was inspired by our flatmate and close friend Justin Wang
        (in retrospect, this domain name was perhaps not the most sensible choice).

        Motivation
      </h3>
      <p>
        While websites such as Google and Wikipedia provide essential utilities
        to the public, the websites which are most memorable to us are those which
         present unique and captivating experiences. These websites often cause us to view
         something with a fresh perspective. We want each user that visits this website
         to be filled with a sense of intrigue and curiosity as they experience modern
         human history in an immersive and interactive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the importance of history as a
        reminder of both our past failures and past successes, providing
        direction and hope as we are faced with the challenges of the 21st century.
        Constructing timelines allow us to see how humanity has progressed,
        not only in general, but within specific fields such as medicine,
        space exploration and computer science.
      </p>
      <h3 class="about-h3">
        Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        When designing this website, we decided to avoid using frameworks
        wherever possible. We viewed this as an opportunity to learn and
        preferred to not abstract away anything that we did not already
        fully understand. It is rewarding to know that every element of this website was designed
        and implemented by us alone. We may use frameworks going forward
        now that we have a full understanding of the details that frameworks
        abstract.
      </p>
      <p> In the <a href="/profile">Profile</a> page, each user is assigned an avatar on page refresh.
        We wanted to create avatars that fit with the philosophy of the website.
        We designed old geometry constructions, edited to look as though they were drawn
        in ink on an academic paper. To us, these avatars symbolise curiosity and
        the boundless pursuit of knowledge.

        Timeline
      </h3>
      <p>For the timeline page, we wanted to create the illusion of moving through time. To achieve this,
        each point in time can be given a position in three dimensional space, and the computer screen
        effectively displays the view of a pinhole camera which is moving through this space. Each contribution
        is then placed at a point in three dimensional space based on its historical date. The user should be
        able to control the speed and direction with which they move through this space, and therefore the speed
        and direction with which they move through time. The timeline is written in pure JavaScript, making use of the HTML5
        <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. The only extrenal library used is
        <a href="https://momentjs.com/">momentjs</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Preliminaries
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Pinhole Camera Model:</strong> The pinhole camera model describes the mathematical relationship between the
        coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space and its projection onto the image plane of an
        ideal pinhole camera, where the camera aperture is described as a point and no lenses are used
        to focus light.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Serialising Dates:</strong> In order to easily compare different points in time, the historical dates were serialised
        according to the number of days that had passed since the beginning of the Roman calendar. When the user
        submits a contribution, the historical date is first serialised before the contribution is added to the database.
        Therefore all calculations and comparisons regarding dates can be done using positive integers. In the
        calculations that follow, each date is an integer value. Serialising was performed using the <a href="https://momentjs.com/">momentjs</a>
        JavaScript library.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Defining a three-dimensional coordinate system
      </h4>
      <p>
        The \(X\) and \(Y\)-axes of the three dimensional space are the usual \(X\) and \(Y\)-axes as expected. It is important
         to note that these axes are not the same as the \(X\) and \(Y\)-axes of the computer screen, which will be denoted
         by lower case \(x\) and \(y\), although they are related. Time is then defined along the \(Z\)-axis. Originally, the \(Z\)-axis was defined with the
         earliest contribution at \(Z = 0\) and the latest contribution at \(z = 100\). However, as the camera is initially positioned at \(Z = 0\),
         the user would not be able to see the first contribution. To account for this, the \(Z\)-position of each
         contribution was offset by a value \(Z_{offset}\). The \(Z\)-axis therefore begins at \(Z = 0\), with earliest contribution at
         \(Z = Z_{offset}\) and the latest contribution at \(100 + Z_{offset}\).
      </p>
      <h4>
        Caclulating the \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\)-position of each conribution
      </h4>
      <p>
        Now that the coordinate space has been defined, the position of each contribution in that coordinate space
        can be calculated using the serialised historical date. Let \(S_{earliest}\) be the serialised date of
        the earliest contribution, let \(S_{latest}\) be the serialised date of the latest contribution, and let
        \(S_{current}\) be the serialised date of the current contribution whose \(Z\)-position we are calculating.
        The \(Z\)-position is then calculated as follows:

        $$ Z_{current} = {\frac{S_{current} - S_{earliest}}{S_{latest} - S_{earliest}}}\cdot{100} + Z_{offset}$$

        which gives

        $$ Z_{offset} \leq Z_{current} \leq Z_{offset} + 100 $$

        We now have the \(Z\)-position of each contribution. However, as the camera moves through this space,
        each contribution will be exactly in front of the next contribution as they share the same \(X\) and \(X\)-positions.
        This also means that the contributions would pass by the camera in the center of the screen. To add to the experience,
        the contributions should pass the camera at different \(X\) and \(Y\)-positions. Each contribution was therefore
        randomly assigned an \(X\) and \(Y\)-position between \(-10\) and \(10\).
      </p>
      <h4>
        Three-Dimensional Projection
      </h4>
        <p>
          The exact position of each contribution in the 3-D space is now known. Next we must define how this
          3-D position relates to the position of the contribution on the 2-D screen. 3-D projection is a method
          of mapping three-dimensional points to a two-dimensional plane. Let \(X_{relative}\), \(Y_{relative}\),
          and \(Z_{relative}\) be the relative position of any point to the camera. Let \(f\) be the focal length,
          which represents the distance between the camera and the 2-D screen in 3-D space. Let \(x_{screen}\)
          and \(y_{screen}\) be the position of a given contribution on the two dimensional screen. Note that for the screen,
          the \(xy\)-coordinate system is centered at the top left corner, and to center the camera on the screen,
          the 2-D position is translated by \((x_{center}, y_{center})\) where

          $$ x_{center} = \frac{ScreenWidth}{2} $$

          and

          $$ y_{center} = \frac{ScreenHeight}{2} $$

          The final 2-D screen position for a contribution is then given by \((x_{screen}, y_{screen})\), where

          $$ x_{screen} = f + \frac{X_{relative}}{Z_{relative}} + x_{center} $$

          and

          $$ y_{screen} = f + \frac{Y_{relative}}{Z_{relative}} + y_{center} $$
        </p>
        <h4>
          Scaling
        </h4>
        <p>
          We now have the position of each contribution on the screen. What remains is to scale these contributions
          based on their distance from the camera. Naturally, the size of each contribution will be inversely proportional
          to its relative \(Z\)-position, as elements that are further away in 3-D space (and therefore also in time) should appear
          smaller on the screen. The size of each contribution is therfore given by

          $$ size = scale \times \frac{1}{Z_{relative}} $$

          where \(scale\) can be defined arbitrarily based on preference.

          This allows us to scale each element of a contribution, creating the illusion of depth on the screen. The
          contribution's opacity value is also defined to be inversely proportional to \(Z_{relative}\), so that
          objects that are further away will fade into the distance. A coloured radial gradient is then applied
          the the background to enhance the illusion of depth.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Displaying the Current Date
        </h4>
        <p>
          To retrieve the date we must calculate the current serialised date corresponding to the \(Z\)-position
           of the camera. This is done by rearranging the equation used to calculate the
            \(Z\)-position of a contribution:

          $$ S_{camera} = (\frac{Z_{camera} - Z_{offset}}{100})\cdot(S_{latest} - S_{earliest}) + S_{earliest}$$

          This serialised date is then converted back to a standard date format and presented to the user.
          This date will update as the camera moves along the \(Z-axis\).
