        Timeline.wang is an interactive timeline created by Ainsley
        Rutterford and James O'Reilly as part of the third year
        computer science unit "Web Technologies" at the University of Bristol.
        The name for the website was inspired by our flatmate and close friend Justin Wang
        (in retrospect, this domain name was perhaps not the most sensible choice).

        While websites such as Google and Wikipedia provide essential utilities
        to the public, the websites which are most memorable to us are those which
         present unique and captivating experiences. These websites often cause us to view
         something with a fresh perspective. We want each user that visits this website
         to be filled with a sense of intrigue and curiosity as they experience modern
         human history in an immersive and interactive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the importance of history both as a
        reminder of both our past failures and past successes, providing
        direction and hope as we are faced with the challenges of the 21st century.
        Constructing timelines allow us to see how humanity has progressed,
        not only in general, but within specific fields such as medicine,
        space exploration and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progress in Medicine: From the disovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming
        in 1928 to the eradication of smallpox in 1977 and the invention gene
        editing technologies like CRISPR recently.

        Progress in Space Exploration: From Laika, the canine comsonaut in 1957 to
        the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 and more recently, SpaceX and the
        invention of reusable rockets.

        Progress in Computer Science: From the development of the C programming language
        in the 1970's, to its implementation in IBM's Deep Blue chess artificial
        intelligence, which famously defeated Gary Kasparov in 1997.

        When designing this website, we decided to avoid using frameworks
        wherever possible. We viewed this as an opportunity to learn and
        preferred to not abstract away anything that we did not already
        fully understand. It is rewarding to know that every element of this website was designed
        and implemented by us alone. We may use frameworks going forward
        now that we have a full understanding of the details that frameworks
        abstract.

      <p> In the "Profile" page, each user is assigned an avatar on page refresh.
        We wanted to create avatars that fit with the philosophy of the website.
        We designed old geometry constructions, edited to look as they were written
        with ink on an academic paper. To us, these avatars symbolise curiosity and
        the boundless pursuit of knowledge.
